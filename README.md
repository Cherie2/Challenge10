## Motivation

The motivation for this project is to provide users with a convenient and efficient way to produce an HTML file with a project's team members and each member's specific information. The HTML file's template includes sections such as the team member's role, name, email, and ID. Additional information such as office number, GitHub username, and Educational Institution is provided depending on what the team member's role is. 

In completing this project, I have learned the basic concepts of node.js while utilizing the inquirer and jest packages. The importance of writing test for applications was made clear when structuring the application.
